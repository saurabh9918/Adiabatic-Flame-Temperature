# Adiabatic-Flame-Temperature
Hydrocarbon when react with Oxygen in Air produces large amount of Heat, this reaction is known as Combustion reaction. In this Code, Combustion reaction is Modelled to calculate the Maximum Adiabatic flame temperature (AFT). AFT is the Maximum temperature generated due to combustion process, considering constant Pressure process.
I have compiled the Matlab code for the calculation of AFT for a given Hydrocarbon for a particular equivalence ratio.

Note- Error generated in the Code will be updated from time to time (once in a week).
